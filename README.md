### Hi there

I am a software developer with a background in financial services and technology with a passion for helping people. I love backend developement with Ruby on Rails and enjoy solving problems through considerate software. Since pursuing a career in Software Development, I have created numerous projects in both Ruby on Rails and Java that have also included uses of test-driven development with RSpec, RESTful APIs, OAuth, PostreSQL, CI, and more.

I look forward to any opportunities to meet others for networking purposes, work opportunities or to just chat about anything tech. Please feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn, or you may email me directly at joelgrantdev@gmail.com.
