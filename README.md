### Hi there

I am a software developer combining a background in financial services and technology with a passion for helping people. Since pursuing a career in Software Development, I have worked on projects in both Ruby on Rails and Java that have also included uses of Git, RSpec, RESTful APIs, OAuth, Postresql, and more.

I enjoy software engineering because of the opportunity to build meaningful applications that are thoughtfully written for their users. I look forward to any opportunities to meet others for networking purposes, work opportunities or to just chat about anything tech. Please feel free to reach out to me here on LinkedIn, or you may email me directly at joelgrantdev@gmail.com.
